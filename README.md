# Blood-Spectroscopy-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
My solution code to a machine learning problem from Zinid.Africa.
My approach utilizes FFT features to train a neural network architecture in a single/multi-input fashion.

Although I am continuously thinking of different angles to arrive at an optimal solution, I believe that FFT features and unsupervised feature learning techniques will be worth exploring further ,whilst bearing in mind the issue of overfitting.

The ultimate goal of this project is to accurately identify the status(high/low/okay) of the substrates of interest in every given spectrum.
